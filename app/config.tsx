        tedious task of creating your own flashcards. With Noodle, as you jot
        down your notes, like magic, we&apos;ll conjure up customized flashcards
        for you. <br /> <br /> But here&apos;s the thing, don&apos;t you even
        think about slacking off on your flashcard homework. Our AI takes it
        personally, and trust me, you don&apos;t want to face the wrath of a
        peeved AI.
